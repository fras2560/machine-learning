Problem Description and Pipeline
---------------------------------------------------------
How do we get computers to understand photos and its details?

Pipeline
	1. Text detection
	2. Character segmentation
	3. Character classification
	4. Word matching -> match your output of all character classification to closest real word

Question
When someone refers to a machine learning pipeline he or she is referring to:
A system with many stages/components, several of which may use machine learning

---------------------------------------------------------
Sliding Windows
---------------------------------------------------------
Question
Suppose you are running a text detector using 20X20 image patches. You run the classifier on a 200X200 image and when using sliding window, you ''step'' the detector by 4 pixels each time. About how many times will you end up running your classifier on a single image?

About 2500 times

---------------------------------------------------------
Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data
---------------------------------------------------------
Creating data -> use random fonts and paste them on random background (synthetic data)

Amplify old data set
	-> can introduce distortions
	-> noise should not be purely random
Question
	Suppose you are training a linear regression model with m examples. Suppose you duplicate every example by making two identical copies of it. That is where you had on example you now have two copies of it, so you now have 2m examples. Is this likely to help?

	No, and in fact you will end up with the same parameters theta as before you duplicated the data.

Question
	You've just joined a product group that has been developing a machine learning application for the last 12 months using 1,000 training examples. Suppose that by manually collecting and labelling examples, it takes you an average of 1- seconds to obtain one extra training example. Suppose you work 9 hours a day. How many days will it take you to get 10,000 examples?
	
	About 3.5 days

---------------------------------------------------------
Ceiling Analysis: What Part of the Pipeline to Work on Next
---------------------------------------------------------
Go through the pipeline, max out a certain part (by manual work)

Question
	Suppose you perform ceiling analysis on a pipelined machine learning system, and when we plug in the ground-truth labels for one of the components, the performance of the overall system improves very little. This probabaly means:
		-> it is probably not worth dedicating engineering resources to improving that component of the system
		-> if that component is a classifier training using gradient descent, it is probably not worth running gradient descent for 10x as long to see if it converges to better classifier parameters

Usually dont trust your gut feeling

Quiz
1.
 Suppose you are running a sliding window detector to find
text in images. Your input images are 1000x1000 pixels. You
will run your sliding windows detector at two scales, 10x10
and 20x20 (i.e., you will run your classifier on lots of 10x10
patches to decide if they contain text or not; and also on
lots of 20x20 patches), and you will "step" your detector by 2
pixels each time. About how many times will you end up
running your classifier on a single 1000x1000 test set image?

	1,000,000

	->500,000

	100,000

	250,000 

2.
 Suppose that you just joined a product team that has been
developing a machine learning application, using m=1,000
training examples. You discover that you have the option of
hiring additional personnel to help collect and label data.
You estimate that you would have to pay each of the labellers
$10 per hour, and that each labeller can label 4 examples per
minute. About how much will it cost to hire labellers to
label 10,000 new training examples?

	->$400

	$600

	$10,000

	$250 
3.
 What are the benefits of performing a ceiling analysis? Check all that apply.

	->It can help indicate that certain components of a system might not be worth a significant amount of work improving, because even if it had perfect performance its impact on the overall system may be small.

	It is a way of providing additional training data to the algorithm.

	->It helps us decide on allocation of resources in terms of which component in a machine learning pipeline to spend more effort on.

	If we have a low-performing component, the ceiling analysis can tell us if that component has a high bias problem or a high variance problem.

4.
Suppose you are building an object classifier, that takes as input an image, and recognizes that image as either containing a car (y=1) or not (y=0). For example, here are a positive example and a negative example:
After carefully analyzing the performance of your algorithm, you conclude that you need more positive (y=1) training examples. Which of the following might be a good way to get additional positive examples?

	->Mirror your training images across the vertical axis (so that a left-facing car now becomes a right-facing one).

	Take a few images from your training set, and add random, gaussian noise to every pixel.

	Take a training example and set a random subset of its pixel to 0 to generate a new example.

	Select two car images and average them to make a third example.

5.
Suppose you have a PhotoOCR system, where you have the following pipeline:
You have decided to perform a ceiling analysis on this system, and find the following:
Which of the following statements are true?

	->If the text detection system was trained using gradient descent, running gradient descent for more iterations is unlikely to help much.

	->If we conclude that the character recognition's errors are mostly due to the character recognition system having high variance, then it may be worth significant effort obtaining additional training data for character recognition.

	We should dedicate significant effort to collecting additional training data for the text detection system.

	The least promising component to work on is the character recognition system, since it is already obtaining 100% accuracy.
